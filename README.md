# 🔐 PasswordHome – .NET Practice Project

Hi there!  
My name is **Sergey Krasikov**, and this is my personal learning project developed as part of my training at **Accenture**. The main goal is to improve my skills in the **.NET** ecosystem, deepen my knowledge of **C#**, and apply best development practices.

## 📌 About the Project

**PasswordHome** is an application designed to securely store passwords and other sensitive data (such as logins, resource names, descriptions, etc.).

This project will evolve step by step — from a basic version to more advanced and feature-rich implementations. This approach allows me to gradually explore .NET and continuously improve the application.

## 🚀 Goals and Plans

- Learn the fundamentals of **.NET** and **C#** through practical application.
- Build a working app that allows:
  - secure storage of passwords;
  - search and filtering of entries;
  - creation, editing, and deletion of records;
- Apply design patterns and SOLID principles;
- Integrate with databases (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MSSQL);
- Future plans: encryption, user authentication, data export/import, cloud storage support.

## 📁 Project Structure

The repository will include **multiple versions of the project**:
- `v1` — basic console-based version;
- `v2` — simple GUI version (e.g., using Windows Forms or WPF);
- `v3+` — advanced versions with extended functionality.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- C#
- .NET (Core / Framework)
- Entity Framework / ADO.NET
- SQLite / PostgreSQL / MSSQL
- (planned) WPF, WinForms, ASP.NET

## 🙌 Acknowledgements

Special thanks to **Accenture** for providing a professional environment to learn and grow.

📌 Stay tuned — the best is yet to come!
